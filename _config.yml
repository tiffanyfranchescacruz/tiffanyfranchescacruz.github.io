# Short bio or description (displayed in the header)
description: Tiffany, a New York City native, holds a Master’s in English Literature from Mills College
  at Northeastern University. She focuses on race in British literature during the long eighteenth and
  nineteenth century. She also explores race in contemporary texts that adapt classic works, examining
  why there is such a strong interest in creating historical novels with these protagonist, and the significance
  of highlighting these people within these novels. She is particularly interested in the constructions
  of genre and how they shape both classical and modern texts, especially in relation to notions of race.
  This fascination extends to how literature influences societal values. This showcases the importance
  of these perspectives, and their contribution to literature during this historical period. She is currently
  a PhD student at Northeastern University getting her degree in English Literature. She also is a member
  of the United Confederation of Taino People.
